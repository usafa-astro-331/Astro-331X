# Astro 331X

This course uses Arduino-based to teach spacecraft concepts. Arduino is a ubiquitous open source electronic prototyping ecosystem built around a series of microcontrollers. 

In this class we will use Arduinos to build a satellite analog called FlatSAT to explore spacecraft design lessons. FlatSAT is a mini version of the FalconSAT Avionics Test Bed (ATB).

## Lab overview

Each lab group of 2-3 students will build a FlatSAT using solderless breadboards. Arduino microcontrollers will run FlatSAT. You will communicate with FlatSAT using the Arduino IDE on the lab computers.  

Each lab will explore a new concept, and will add new components to FlatSAT.

Lab 0 is a metrology lab, but it doesn’t get a number because we don’t start building FlatSAT until the electrical system lab. 

1. electrical system
2. camera payload
3. radio communications
4. attitude determination and control



## Course overview

In general, each day will cover

- topical lecture
- pre-lab predictions
- lab execution
- data analysis



## Computer environment

We will use the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) to communicate with FlatSAT. We will also use several otehr tools to organize code and other course materials. 

- git: software distribution and version control
  
  - tortoisegit: windows explorer integration for git

- typedown: markdown viewer/editor (for lab instructions)

- arduino-cli: manage arduino libraries

## Getting started

Before the first lab, open the `computer_environment` folder and follow the instructions in `README.md`. 

Instructions and code for each lab are located in the lab's numbered folder.
