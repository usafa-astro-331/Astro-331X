# Astro 331X

In this class we will use Arduinos to build a satellite analog called FlatSAT to explore spacecraft design lessons. FlatSAT is a mini version of the FalconSAT Avionics Test Bed (ATB).

## Lab overview

Each lab group will build a FlatSAT using solderless breadboards. Arduino microcontrollers will run FlatSAT. You will communicate with FlatSAT using the Arduino IDE. 

Each lab will explore a new concept, and will add new components to FlatSAT.

Lab 0 is a metrology lab, but it doesn’t get a number because we don’t start building FlatSAT until the electrical system lab. 

1. electrical system
2. camera payload
3. radio communications
4. attitude determination and control



## Schedule

In general, each day will cover

- topical lecture
- pre-lab predictions
